# Getting Started

**Quick note before we get started**: You will need a credit card to sign up for an AWS account.

## What are we going to cover?

We're going to be looking at getting a single-page application…

- hosted on AWS,
- distributed globally,
- secured with SSL,
- automatically deployed with CI/CD,
- passing [Mozilla's security scanner with flying colors](https://observatory.mozilla.org/),
- and dynamically responding to requests.

We're not going to cover the following:

- **Servers**. This course is focused on the distributiuon of your client-side application. Jem Young has an awesome [course on setting up servers](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/fullstack-v2/) to watch after this.
- **Serverless**. [Scott Moss](https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/scott-moss/) has [an amazing workshop](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/serverless-aws/) that you should totally go watch—after this one, of course.
